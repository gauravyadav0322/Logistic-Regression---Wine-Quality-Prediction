# Logistic-Regression---Wine-Quality-Prediction
Built a Logistic Regression model to classify wine quality (good vs. bad) using chemical properties. The notebook covers data preprocessing, visualization, modeling, and performance analysis.


🍷 Predicting Wine Quality Using Logistic Regression

This project builds a machine learning model to predict wine quality based on various chemical properties using Logistic Regression. The notebook covers data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature preparation, and model evaluation.

📂 Project Overview

Data Cleaning: Removed unnecessary columns, explored datatypes, checked for nulls.

EDA: Visualized relationships using pairplots to understand how acidity, alcohol, pH, sulphates, etc., impact wine quality.

Modeling: Implemented Logistic Regression to classify wine as good (quality ≥ 6) or not.

Evaluation: Generated accuracy metrics and classification reports to assess model performance.
